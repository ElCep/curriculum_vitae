## What is Awesome CV?

**Awesome CV** is LaTeX template for a **CV(Curriculum Vitae)**, **Résumé** or **Cover Letter** inspired by [Fancy CV](https://www.sharelatex.com/templates/cv-or-resume/fancy-cv). It is easy to customize your own template, especially since it is really written by a clean, semantic markup.

You can find the original github repro : https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV

## How to Use

To compile the resume, make sure you have both `texlive` and `texlive-extra` installed. Then simply run the makefile 

```bash
make
```
